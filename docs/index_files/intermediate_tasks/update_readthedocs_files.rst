Make a change to the documentation
**********************************

We use Python's Sphinx module to help create documentation.

The official site is here:

A great tutorial with hints and tips is here: https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/brandons-sphinx-tutorial/latest/brandons-sphinx-tutorial.pdf

h2 -- The task

Keeping the documentation up-to-date is key to helping us work together. It also helps beginners join in, which is a significant part of this project.

You can help by updating the documentation. If you are not sure what to change, try checking the "Issues" page on Github or the Discord threads to see if there are any tasks or jargon words which have caused people problems.
Please check the existing structure of the documentaion to see where your explanation best fits (eg, the "jargon" page).
