Jargon list
***********

Branch == A copy of the project's files. Before working on the project's files, users should create a "branch" of the project and "clone" that to their own computer. If the contributor is successful, the branch will eventually be merged into the master branch.

Core App == the primary module of the project, with which all other apps must be compatible.

DB == "database". The database we use is Postgresql

Projects tab == The fourth tab along under the headings on this page: https://github.com/LearnToCodeApp-Group/LearnToCodeApp

Pull Request == A request on Github (using the Pull Request tab) for the contributor's code to be added to the master branch.

UI == User Interface. This is the user facing part of the software - the "screens" or pages that the user interacts with. In a website it would be the webpage, for Firefox it would be the Toolbar and settings pages etc.

Views == A web page generated by the Django templating system. In other words, it is an HTML webpage seen by either a user of the programme or a client (if client login in enabled).

Work stream == One of the main workflows for the project. To see how these are divided, please see the "How to Contribute" page.
