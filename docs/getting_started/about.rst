h1 -- About - a summary of the project

The LearnToCodeApp project has been created to provide a focus for learning programming and working collaboratively. Everyone is encouraged to join in, whatever the level of their experience.

The overall aim is to produce office administration software. We intend to produce the software in a modular form, allowing developers to work on and duplicate individual parts of the project. Users should be able to pick and choose functionality by including or omitting modules.

The Core App is a generic module intended to help a business organize itself. In particular, the Core App will:

    + Provide a contact database (including contact details)
    + Provide a database of projects carried out for clients (which might otherwise be known as "files" or "accounts").

The Core App will be browser based.
