h1 -- Suggest an Issue

Github allows collaborators and third parties to suggest improvements to a project. Improvements might be:

    + Something the software does that it should not or, conversely, that it does not do but it should (a bug)
    + Something the software does not do but could be included (an improvement or "feature request")
    + A piece of code which is not explained well enough in the documentation.

Suggesting an improvement is quite a simple way of getting involved.

First, you will need to check the Issues page on Github to check whether the issue has already been raised.

Then, you will need to choose the most appropriate template for your issue: A 'bug report' or 'feature request'.

Use the template to describe the issue.

Lastly, submit the issue.
